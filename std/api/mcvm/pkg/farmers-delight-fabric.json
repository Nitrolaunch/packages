Hopefully this will encourage you to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n### **IMPORTANT, BREAKING CHANGES on _1.2.0(MC1.18.2)_ and _1.3.1(MC1.19)_**\n> **This update is a major upgrade, I recommend that you make a backup of your world before updating to this version, because this version modifies identifiers of entities, blocks and items for pantries that have been renamed to cabinet. The mod will try to migrate, but will delete all pantries placed in inventory and world if it does not succeed to migrate.**\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Follow the advancements!** Much of its progression is described through them. By default, press the (L) key to open the Advancements screen.\n\nIf you'd rather get a more straight-forward guide, we wrote a *__[Getting Started](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started)__* to help you learn the basics!\n\n\n## Beta Version\n\nThis mod is currently **under development**, so issues and instabilities may occur. If you'd like to play, keep in mind:\n* **Backup your saves often**;\n* Make sure everything is working before adding it to a modpack;\n* Report any issues you find to our **[issue tracker](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues)**! It helps us a lot!\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n***Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?***\n> Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n> * Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n> * Remember that this mod is in beta, so keep and eye out for major gameplay changes and additions that may happen between versions.\n\n***Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?***\n> Farmer's Delight will always keep up with the latest version of Minecraft, with temporary support for the previous one. As of now:\n> * The current focus is exclusively on version(s) : 1.19 and 1.18.2;\n> * This mod port will never be backported to any version prior to 1.16.5 (please don't ask further);\n\n***Q. Do you have a Patreon, or similar means of supporting your work?***\n> Not currently, but thanks for your consideration! I'm currently well-sustaned by a stable job, and my personal projects are hobbies I work on my free time. My suggestion is to donate your money to more worthy causes, or just treat yourself to a nice lunch. ;)\n\n\n## Links:\n\n* [Discord for Help and Feedbacks (Fabric version)](https://discord.gg/MskvEhPDQz)\n* [Report Issues](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues)\n* [Discord of main mod/author (Forge version)](https://discord.gg/eFsz5SK)\n* [Twitter vectorwing (original forge mod author)](https://twitter.com/vectorwing)",
