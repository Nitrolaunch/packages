And of some machines moving beneath their surface? Gigantic rusty gears, pistons and pipes. Wandering blue lights that lure strangers into the mire. The atrocious amalgam of living metal and rotting plants...\n\n\n\n## About\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z0j8H5Puzkk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br></br>\n\n**Beneath the Wetlands** is a Fabric vanilla-style mod created by the **Birchfolks** team and inspired by a creepypasta. It focuses on expansion of the content related to swamp biomes. The mod adds new mobs, block, items and structures--old mechanisms lurking in the depths of the wetlands. **BtW** is under active development and more features are to come soon.\n\n[Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and [GeckoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/geckolib) are required.  \n**BtW** is compatible with generation mods, even with those that add new biomes (for the structures to generate in them, names of these biomes must be written manually in the config file).\n\nCurrently **BtW** supports the following languages:\n\n<center>\nEnglish | Polish | Russian | Ukrainian | Pre-reform Russian\n</center>\n<br>\n\nSince the translations may not be 100% and we aim to add more languages, we seek for community help. If you want to translate the mod into the language you speak, feel free to contact us on Discord.\n\n[![Beneath the Wetlands](https://images2.imgbox.com/be/9e/nYM4l4dY_o.png)](https://discord.gg/6hZMsGqHWb)\n\n## Features\n\n### Mobs\n* **Elder Gear Golem** - a mini-boss with different attacks with that can be activated in its dungeon in the swamps\n* **Gear Golem** - a friendly mob that can be built by a player (the same principle as with an iron golem but an animated copper gear needs to be placed on its back)\n* **Will-o'-the-Wisp** - spawns in the swamps at night and starts fleeing as a player approaches\n\n### Blocks and Items\n* **Sapropel Block** - generates on the bottom of the swamps, breaks into several pieces of sapropel\n* **Sapropel** - can be put into a composter for bone meal\n* **Peat and Dry Peat** - as well generates on the bottom of the swamps, can be dried in the furnace and used as fuel\n* **Mire Block** - toxic goo that generates in the swamps in the form of small lakes\n* **Sulfur Nugget** - has a chance to drop out of peat, can be used to craft torches and as a one-time flint and steel\n* **Bog Iron Ore** - generates on the bottom of the swamps\n* **Raw Bog Iron**\n* **Raw Bog Iron Block**\n* **Bog Iron Ingot** - can be re-melted into a common iron ingot\n* **Block of Bog Iron**\n* **Tattered Block of Bog Iron**\n* **Cut Bog Iron, Slab, Stairs**\n* **Sunken Bricks, Slab, Stairs, Wall**\n* **Fume Trap** - redstone-powered block that emits hot fumes\n* **Copper Valve** - essentially works like a lever but can be waterlogged\n* **Bottled Will-o'-the-Wisp** - obtained by clicking on a will-o'-the-wisp with a bottle\n* **Copper Gear** - a decorative block, can't be used in redstone mechanisms\n* **Animated Copper Gear** - used to build a copper golem, can be either crafted with a bottled will-o'-the-wisp and a copper gear or by clicking with the former on the latter\n* **Broken Copper Gear** - an old, oxidized version of a copper gear\n* **Animated Broken Copper Gear** - same as an animated copper gear but is used for activating an elder gear golem\n* **Elder Gear Golem Heart** - drops from an elder gear golem, can be used for crafting an oxidizer\n* **Oxidizer** - launches explosives that damage mobs and oxidize copper blocks\n* **Spawn Eggs** - for every new mob\n\n### Structures\n* **Elder Golem Dungeon** - a rare structure where a player can find resources to build an elder gear golem and fight it\n* **Pipes, cogs, cisterns, pistons, mechanisms** - in many forms\n\n### Other\n* **Advancements**\n* **Swamp Call Sounds** - rarely appear at night in swamp biomes\n* **Config file** - a file with some mod settings that can be tweaked (what biomes the structures generate in, does an elder gear golem have a bossbar)\n* **Some hidden minor mechanics!**\n\n## Authors & Community\n\n**BtW** is created by **Birchfolks**, a team of 3 developers: Neorgothic (art designer), notulum (programmer), xannysnomore (producer).\n\nOur beloved contributers: Maro, The Old Serpent\n\nWe encourage everyone to join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/6hZMsGqHWb), [report bugs](https://github.com/birchfolks/Beneath-the-Wetlands/issues) and take part in translation. Fair use in modpacks and videos is welcomed.\n\n## FAQ\n<details>\n<summary>FAQ</summary>\n\n**Q: What creepypasta this mod is based on?**  \nA: It's a short creepypasta from an image board, you can read it translated into English in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/6hZMsGqHWb).\n\n**Q: What versions of Minecraft are supported?**  \nA: Currently 1.19.2 and 1.20.1. We aim to support the newest versions.\n\n**Q: Can you downgrade this mod to 1.12.2?**  \nA: No. Downgrading a mod is very tedious and some features might break.\n\n**Q: Can you make a Forge version of this mod?**  \nA: Definetely not now or soon. Fabric is much more user- and developer-friendly. But maybe some day.\n\n**Q: Why does updating take so long?**  \nA: There're only three of us and modding isn't our job (unfortunately). We do it in our free time.\n\n**Q: Can you translate this mod to [language]?**  \nA: No, but maybe you can. If you want to translate the mod into the language you speak, contact us via the dedicated channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/6hZMsGqHWb).\n\n**Q: Can the structures of this mod generate in the biomes of other mods?**  \nA: Yes, but for this to happen you need to manually put the names of biomes in the config file. We didn't make the structures generate in any swamp biomes by default in case you wouldn't want BtW to interfere with other mods.\n\n**Q: Where can I find the config file?**  \nA: There's a folder in the Minecraft root directory named \"config\", inside of it you can find \"wetlands.json\".\n\n</details>\n\n![Beneath the Wetlands](https://images2.imgbox.com/f1/84/vCXrifcS_o.png)",
