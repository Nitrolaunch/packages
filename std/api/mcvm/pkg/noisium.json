There are also 3\nother smaller optimisations, that increase biome population speed, chunk unlocking speed, and the speed of sampling blockstates for\ngeneration.  \nIn `NoiseChunkGenerator#populateNoise`, setting the blockstate via abstractions/built-in functions is bypassed. Instead, the blocks are set\ndirectly in the palette storage, thus bypassing a lot of calculations and things Minecraft does that are normally useful when blocks are\nset, but when generating the world only slow it down, this is a cycle optimisation.\n\nNoisium has full 1:1 parity with vanilla worldgen (worldgen without Noisium).\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Required\n\nNone.\n\n## Compatibility info\n\n### Compatible mods\n\nNoisium should be compatible with most, if not all, of the popular optimisation mods currently on Modrinth/CurseForge for\nMinecraft `1.20.x`, since Noisium aims to fill in the gaps in performance optimisation left by other mods.\nThis includes (but is not limited to) C2ME, Lithium, Nvidium, and Sodium.\n\n- C2ME: every world generation thread runs faster. The biome population multithreading is also done in a much better/more performant way in\n  C2ME, so it's been removed from Noisium since `v1.0.2`. It's suggested to run C2ME alongside Noisium for even better world generation\n  performance.\n- Distant Horizons: Noisium speeds up LOD world generation threads, since LOD generation depends on Minecraft's world generation speed.\n- ReTerraForged: RTF has built-in compatibility with Noisium, to fully utilize the optimisations during RTF world generation.\n\n### Incompatibilities\n\nSee the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Steveplays28/noisium/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Acompatibility) for a list of incompatibilities.\n\n## Download\n\n[![GitHub](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/cozy/available/github_vector.svg)](https://github.com/Steveplays28/noisium)\n[![Modrinth](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/cozy/available/modrinth_vector.svg)](https://modrinth.com/mod/noisium)\n[![CurseForge](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/cozy/available/curseforge_vector.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/noisium)\n\n![Fabric](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/compact/supported/fabric_vector.svg)\n![Quilt](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/compact/supported/quilt_vector.svg)\n![Forge](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/raw/2dc967fc44dc73850eee42c133a55c8ffc5e30cb/assets/compact/supported/forge_vector.svg)\n![NeoForge](https://github.com/Steveplays28/noisium/raw/24de632923c03864d65568a2cb5ce1e2cee0a304/docs/assets/badges/compact/supported/neoforge_vector.svg)\n\nSee the version info in the filename for the supported Minecraft versions.  \nMade for the Fabric, Quilt, Forge, and NeoForge modloaders. The `merged` JAR works on all aforementioned modloaders.  \nServer side.\n\n## FAQ\n\n- Q: Will you be backporting this mod to lower Minecraft versions?  \n  A: No.\n\n- Q: Does this mod work in multiplayer?  \n  A: Yes, but it'll only improve performance on the server.\n\n- Q: Does only the server need this mod or does the client need it too?  \n  A: Only the server needs this mod (but it works on the client too if you're going to host LAN or play singleplayer).\n\n## Attribution\n\n- Thanks to [Builderb0y](https://modrinth.com/user/Builderb0y) for giving great starting points and helping with some issues.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under LGPLv3, see [LICENSE](https://github.com/Steveplays28/noisium/blob/main/LICENSE).\n",
