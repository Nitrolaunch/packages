As a successor to BCLib, WoVer is intended to eventually take its\nplace. Embracing Minecraft's data-driven world generation methodology, it aims to increase the value of data elements\n(i.e. ResourcePacks, DataPacks, etc.) in modding, and to provide a more flexible and powerful way to create and modify\nworlds.\nIn addition, WoVer is designed to integrate seamlessly with the vanilla game, other mods and world generation data\npacks.\n\n**Please note** that this mod is still in early development and is not yet ready for use. This means that:\n\n- The API is not yet stable and may change significantly between versions.\n- There may be game breaking bugs that cannot be undone and may destroy worlds.\n- Documentation may be missing for some parts, especially those that are still under active development.\n\nWe will provide more information in the near future.",
