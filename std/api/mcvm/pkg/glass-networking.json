		"long_description": "This is a library mod that makes it insanely easy to add and use custom packets.\n\nNot as flexible and extensible as StationAPI's system, but it works well for those who don't want to make StationAPI a hard dependency. Compatible with StationAPI.\n\n## Features:\n- Server and client know if each other has the mod, while still being able to connect to vanilla servers and clients.\n- Automatic packet short-circuiting for clients in singleplayer, or servers sending packets to itself, allowing for less side checks.\n\n## How to use (modders)\n###### Assumes you already know a little on how packets work.\n\n- Implement the `GlassPacketListener` class and implement the method. There's a `registerGlassPacket` convenience method.\n- Add an entrypoint for `glassnetworking`, and point it to your new class.\n  - The applicator field is where you should insert a lambda or method reference to handle what should happen when your packet is received.\n- Send packets from wherever you need in code, and watch as things just work(tm).",
