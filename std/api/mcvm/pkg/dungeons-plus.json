All code is open source and documented.\n\n# ‚õ∫ Summary\n\nDungeons Plus adds 7 new dungeons to the game with maps to guide you on a journey between them.\n\n**üß™ Latest Updates**\n\n\n# ‚öîÔ∏è Dungeons\n\n![Dungeons](https://cdn.moddinglegacy.com/817465634292533874-all-dungeons.png)\n\n### Tower\n\nThese towers have four floors with monster spawners and loot. The first three floors are randomized and can be zombie, spider, or skeleton rooms. The fourth floor is a vex room. Inside this tower, you can find a map that will lead you to the buried dungeon. Generates in either plains, forests, roofed forests, birch forests, and mountains.\n\n### Reanimated Ruins\n\nFound underground, this labyrinth of rooms will lead you to either the Snowy Temple, Leviathan, or Warped Garden depending on what variant of this structure you find.\n\n### Leviathan\n\nThis ancient skeleton can be found in deserts and hides a secret beneath. Explore the ancient temple and find the treasures that rest within. Legend has it that this is where the Leviathan Blade resides. Along with treasure, the husks that spawn here are capable of dropping sand with their normal loot.\n\n### Snowy Temple\n\nThis abandoned temple of old has long since been taken over by Strays. At the top, you‚Äôll find the Frosted Cowl to aid you in your combat. Strays spawned within this structure can drop ice, or rarely packed ice, on death, and they‚Äôre the only mob allowed to spawn inside{: style=‚Äùfont-size: 1.2em; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;‚Äù}\n\n### Warped Garden\n\nThis shell of an undersea town is home to many axe-wielding drowned and provides a renewable source of coral blocks. Weapons from a time forgotten, such as the Warped Axe, can still be found inside.\n\n### End Ruins\n\nOnce you defeat the dragon and gain access to the outer islands, you may be lucky enough to find this dilapidated structure. There isn‚Äôt much loot inside, but at the top of the tower, you can find a dragon egg. Be careful though, the endermen inside aren‚Äôt quite as peaceful as the ones outside of the structure.\n\n### Soul Prison\n\nFound in the lava pools of the Nether‚Äôs soul sand valley, you may find this prison of souls. With the amount of ghasts surrounding it, approaching and reaching the top for your reward may prove to be a no small task. Be wary as the ghasts are not opposed to destroying the structure around you with their fireballs. Should you survive, you may walk out with a Soul Cannon.\n\n\nüåê Translate Dungeons Plus - help break the language barrier!\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll translators are credited here that have translated the mod to their native languages.
