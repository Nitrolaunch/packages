		"long_description": "# Minecraft: Java Edition - Trailier Tales\nAfter the Wild Update controversy passed, Trails & Tales came along and effectively accomplished the same thing. Although it didn't overpromise, it felt as though it had under-delivered on the content side of things.\nWe're back once again to hopefully remedy this, with Trailier Tales!\n\n**DISCLAIMER**\nDo not use this mod in attempt to harass Mojang. They are hard workers and know what's best for their game; We're simply adding and changing features as we see fit.\n\n# NEW FEATURES\n- Added new Ruins structures\n- Added new Pottery Sherds\n- Added new Armor Trims\n- Added Suspicious Red Sand\n- Added Suspicious Clay\n- Added Suspicious Dirt\n- Added Cyan Roses\n- Added Manedrops\n- Added Dawntrails\n- Added the Surveyor block\n- Added Catacombs\n- Added Haunt mob effect\n- Added Transfiguring mobb effect\n- Added Siege Omen\n- Added the Coffin block\n- Added Apparition mob\n- Added the Rebrush enchantment\n- Added the Reaping enchantment\n- Added Music Disc Fausse Vie\n- Expanded and finished many building block sets\n- Banners can now be placed on Boats\n\n## RUINS\n- Added Ruins in all Plains and Forest biomes\n- Added Jungle Ruins in all Jungle biomes\n- Added Savanna Ruins in Savanna and Savanna Plateau biomes\n- Added Desert Ruins in all Desert biomes\n- Added Badlands Ruins in Badlands, Wooded Badlands, and Eroded Badlands biomes\n- Added Deepslate Ruins in the Deep Dark biome\n- Will usually generate in clusters\n- Suspicious blocks will these structures contain new pottery sherds\n- From most to least common, each building can be either partially buried, on the surface, or completely buried\n- New structure pieces for each ruin type can easily be added by dragging and dropping a piece in `.nbt` format into one of the existing subfolders in their respective `trailiertales:structure/ruins/` folder\n\n## POTTERY SHERDS\n- Added Bait Pottery Sherd\n- Added Bloom Pottery Sherd\n- Added Bolt Pottery Sherd\n- Added Bullseye Pottery Sherd\n- Added Cluck Pottery Sherd\n- Added Crawl Pottery Sherd\n- Added Crescent Pottery Sherd\n- Added Cultivator Pottery Sherd\n- Added Essence Pottery Sherd\n- Added Eye Pottery Sherd\n- Added Focus Pottery Sherd\n- Added Height Pottery Sherd\n- Added Hump Pottery Sherd\n- Added Illuminator Pottery Sherd\n- Added Incidence Pottery Sherd\n- Added Lumber Pottery Sherd\n- Added Navigator Pottery Sherd\n- Added Needles Pottery Sherd\n- Added Omen Pottery Sherd\n- Added Plume Pottery Sherd\n- Added Protection Pottery Sherd\n- Added Shed Pottery Sherd\n- Added Shine Pottery Sherd\n- Added Shower Pottery Sherd\n- Added Spade Pottery Sherd\n- Added Sprout Pottery Sherd\n- Added Vessel Pottery Sherd\n- Added Wither Pottery Sherd\n\n## ARMOR TRIMS\n- Added Undead Armor Trim, found in Catacombs\n- Added Matrix Armor Trim, found in Catacombs\n- Added Martyr Armor Trim, found in Badlands Ruins\n- Added Zephyr Armor Trim, found in Desert Ruins\n- Added Cot Armor Trim, found in Savanna Ruins\n- Added Overgrowth Armor Trim, found in Jungle Ruins\n- Added Geode Armor Trim, found in Deepslate Ruins\n\n## CYAN ROSE\n- Sniffers can now dig up Cyan Rose Seeds\n- Seeds can be planted, growing into the Cyan Rose flower\n- Can be crafted into Cyan Dye\n\n## MANEDROP\n- Sniffers can now dig up Manedrop Germs\n- Germs can be planted, and grow into the Manedrop flower\n- Can be crafted into Purple Dye\n\n## DAWNTRAIL\n- Sniffers can now dig up Dawntrail Seeds\n- Seeds can be planted, growing into the Dawntrail\n- Dawntrails will slowly spread outwards at a maximum of 3 blocks\n    -

Some tombs are laid out as puzzles, while others strictly focus on combat\n- Being so difficult and dark, it is recommended to bring strong tools, armor, and a lot of torches\n- Catacombs Explorer Maps can be found in Trail Ruins, and traded for with Cartographer Villagers\n\n## HAUNT\n- A new mob effect\n- Much like the Darkness mob effect, brings dark fog inwards and dampens light\n- Blocks out health, armor, hunger, and air supply stats, becoming either invisible or unreadable to the player\n- Halves the distance sounds can be heard from\n- Coffins can detect any player with this mob effect\n\n## TRANSFIGURING\n- A new mob effect obtained through brewing\n    -

The mob can be changed by using a spawn egg on the Coffin\n- Is inactive by default, but will spawn an Apparition occasionally\n    - One the Apparition has targeted a player, the Coffin will activate and begin spawning mobs\n    - Once the Apparition has been killed, the Coffin will become inactive and the cycle will repeat\n- Each time a spawned mob its killed, will increase the Coffin's power along three stages\n    - Active\n        - The default strength\n        - 400 ticks between spawns\n        - Only one mob can spawn at a time\n    - Irritated\n        - An intermediate strength triggered at a power of 4\n        - 300 ticks between spawns\n        - The amount of simultaneous spawned mobs per extra player increases to one\n    - Irritated\n        - The highest strength triggered at a power of 12\n        - 200 ticks between spawns\n    - A Coffin's power will reset after 12000 ticks, or 10 minutes\n- If all spawned mobs from each stage are defeated in a timely manner, the Coffin will remain inactive for the next 30 minutes\n\n## APPARITION\n- A new mysterious mob that spawns from Coffins\n- Can travel through blocks and other mobs\n- Detects players at relatively far distances\n- Will occasionally \"hypnotize\" nearby mobs, causing them to target the player\n- Finds dropped items and throws them to damage the player\n- Is invisible in the darkness, aside from a particle trail\n- Will apply the Haunt mob effect if it has been in direct contact with a player for long enough\n- Drops Ectoplasm upon death, which can be used as a potion ingredient or to craft the Surveyor block\n\n## REBRUSH\n- A new enchantment found from Chests in Catacombs\n- At a rate of 10% per level, has a chance to let a Suspicious block be looted again\n    -
