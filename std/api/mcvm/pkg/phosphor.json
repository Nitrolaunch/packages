		"long_description": "## Maintenance Status\n\nPhosphor is not currently maintained due to a lack of available time and resources. As of Minecraft 1.20, there have been significant improvements to the game's lighting engine, and most of Phosphor's patches are no longer applicable or useful. ([see more]([https://github.com/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric/issues/95#issuecomment-1605802300](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/phosphor-fabric/issues/95#issuecomment-1605802300)))\n\nYou may also be interested in our other mods, [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) and [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium).\n\n---\n\n(This page continues as it was historically written.)\n\nPhosphor is a Minecraft mod which works to optimize one of game's most inefficient areas-- the lighting engine. It works on both the client and server, and can be installed on servers without requiring clients to also have the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nWith Phosphor, the amount of time the game takes to generate new chunks can be greatly reduced, and you can expect to see some of the nastier frame stutters caused by loading chunks on the client simply vanish.\n\n<br>\n\nIt's a no-compromises solution for improving performance either in single-player or large multi-player servers, and changes no features or behaviors of the vanilla game. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla behaviours has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n\n",
