Currently, this includes the following fixes:\n- The `steep` surface rule (which in vanilla gives Jagged Peaks stone faces) now affects *all* directions, not just the north and east-facing sides.\n- Snow layers correctly generate both below and on trees.\n\n**Note: A Fabric version will also be releasing, but is not ready yet due to toolchain issues.**",
