Do not report issues encountered with it to their bug tracker or in their\nDiscord. You can report issues on the [Xenon GitHub](https://github.com/anthxnymc/xenon) or on my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/c6BBguCUWx).\n\n## Compatibility\n\n**OptiFine is not supported**. This mod replaces OptiFine.\n\nXenon will work with everything Embeddium does, as it is a fork. We intend to keep compatibility\nwith upstream and Embeddium / Forge Sodium addons as much as possible.\n\n## Shaders\n\nFor now, please continue to use [Oculus](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oculus) if you want shader support.\nIf you encounter issues with shaders installed, disable Oculus first, and if that fixes it, report the issue to them instead. \n\n## Credits\n\n* JellySquid & the CaffeineMC team, for making Sodium in the first place, without which this project would not be possible\n* Asek3, for the initial port to Forge\n* embeddedt for their work on Embeddium, from which this mod is forked\n* FlashyReese & TexTrue for the vertical video options mod, and its Forge port, respectively.\n* SrRapero720 for bug fixes and contributions to Embeddium Extras.\n* XFactHD, for providing a list of gamebreaking Rubidium issues to start this work off, and for testing early builds\n* Pepper, for their invaluable assistance with getting Forge lighting to work on Sodium 0.5\n\n## License\n\nXenon currently follows the license of upstream Sodium (LGPL-3.0).\n\n[Our Discord](https://discord.gg/kyBCuYUzFB)",
