		"long_description": "### Join me on Discord! https://discord.gg/aqASuWebRU\n\n## Forge Version: https://modrinth.com/mod/more-geodes-reforged\n\n# More Geodes!\n\nWith the addition of Amethyst Geodes in the Caves and Cliffs Update, I felt that Emerald Geodes would be a neat feature in addition to amethyst geodes. The idea of emerald geodes is to incentivize mining for emeralds, rather than trading for them and also provides less experienced players with a relatively intuitive way of farming emeralds. Since then, this mod has expanded to also include Quartz Geodes, Diamond Geodes, and Echo Geodes! \n\n# Emerald Geodes\n\nEmerald geodes behave very similarly to amethyst geodes; they generate at high elevations throughout the Overworld, though they are most abundant in Mountain-type biomes. They are encased in calcite and smooth basalt casings underground and can grow emerald crystal buds. When these buds are harvested, they of course drop emeralds. This provides an automate-able alternative to emerald farming rather than just trading endlessly.\n\n<center>\n<figure>\n  <img\n  src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/main/docs/images/emerald_geode.png\"\n  alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption>Iron Golems jealously guard the Village's Emerald Geode</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</center>\n\n# Quartz Geodes\nQuartz geodes are a little more special. While their growth mechanics are identical to amethyst and emerald geodes, they generate exclusively in The Nether, and with tuff instead of calcite. Their buds also have a special **oscillator** property. When powered with an external redstone signal, they will pulse on and off, emitting a signal like a redstone clock! The frequency of these pulses increases as the crystal grows. \n\n<center>\n<figure>\n  <img\n  src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/main/docs/images/quartz_geode.png\"\n  alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption>A Quartz Geode is exposed under an overhang in a Soul Sand Valley</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</center>\n\n# Diamond Geodes\n\nDiamond geodes are best thought of as small goody boxes you will sometimes come across when mining. They have no budding block, so **diamonds cannot be grown like in other geodes**. They also only have one cluster type, which will drop 1 diamond when broken, scaling with fortune. Diamond geodes also generate flooded and with deepslate coal ore in place of calcite, as they are formed from carbon deposits in real life (and not in geodes, but hey its Minecraft). \n\n<center>\n<figure>\n  <img\n  src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/main/docs/images/diamond_geode.png\"\n  alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption>A drained Diamond Geode is excavated for its riches</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</center>\n\n# Echo Geodes\n\nEcho Geodes generate in the Deep Dark, and can renewably produce Echo Shards. They generate with an outer layer of blackstone, a middle layer of sculk, and an inner layer of the new Echo Block! Echo blocks, budding echo blocks, and all the echo crystals behave very similarly to their amethyst counter parts - except they echo whenever they make a sound! \n\n<center>\n<figure>\n  <img\n  src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/main/docs/images/echo_geode.png\"\n  alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption>The Warden blocks entry into an Echo Geode</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</center>\n\n# Lapis Lazuli Geodes\n\nLapis Lazuli Geodes generate abundantly in deserts, and at shallow depths in the rest of the Overworld. Instead of Calcite, they have a middle layer of **Pyrite** (commonly known as Fool's Gold). Pyrite can be crafted in stairs, slabs, and walls, and even bartered with Piglins! Small Lapis Buds will drop a chunk of Pyrite when mined, so there is a reason to farm them over the clusters.\n\n<center>\n<figure>\n  <img\n  src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/main/docs/images/lapis_geode.png\"\n  alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption>A Lapis Lazuli Geode on the side of a cave entrance in a Desert</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</center>\n\n# Gypsum Roses\n\nBased on real-life Desert Roses, Gypsum Roses can be found on the surface of deserts and badlands, and grow to be much larger than other crystals. They can be harvested for their Gypsum Shards, which can be composted and craft sand. They can also be cut into a new decorative block set, or crafted to make the [Crystal Locator](#crystal-and-echo-locator)!\n\n<center>\n<figure>\n  <img\n  src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/main/docs/images/gypsum_patch.png\"\n  alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption>A couple patches of Gypsum Roses growing in the desert</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</center>\n\n# Crystal and Echo Locator\n\nThe Crystal Locator is an item that can be used to help find geodes. When tuned to the correct Crystal type, they can be used to make any nearby crystal clusters or buds of the corresponding type glow for about a second and make a dinging sound. They are crafted using 4 Gypsum Shards and 2 sticks. The Crystal locator can be tuned to Amethyst, Emerald, Quartz, Lapis Lazuli, Diamond, and Echo geodes. There is also integration for [Spectrum's](https://modrinth.com/mod/spectrum) geodes.\n\nThe Echo Locator is a more late-game version of the Crystal Locator. It is more tuned to the frequency of ores, and can therefore be used to help locate those pesky ores hidden just inside the wall of a cave or mineshaft.\n\n# Optional Datapack Addons\n\nTwo optional data pack add-ons can be installed with this mod. These add-ons can be downloaded on the Releases tab of this mod's GitHub here: https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/releases/\n\n(Not that these releases are not approved by Modrinth)\n\n## Disable Emerald and Quartz Ore Generation\n\nThis does exactly as it says: it disables the generation of emerald and quartz ore so that geodes are the only way to obtain their respective resources (from mining, anyway).\n\n## Budding Blocks Silktouchable\nThis allows Budding Amethyst, Budding Echo, Budding Emerald, and Budding Quartz blocks to drop themselves when mined with silk touch!\n\n# Configuration and More Detail\n\nYou can find much more detail about configuration and how the mod works in the [read me](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/more-geodes/blob/main/README.md)!\n\n# Requirements\n\nThis mod requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api). If you are using Quilt, you must use [Quilited Fabric API/Quilt Standard Library](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) instead. ",
