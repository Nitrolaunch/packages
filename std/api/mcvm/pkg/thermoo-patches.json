This is because newer versions may introduce breaking changes that could result in my additions not working, and so it is marked as incompatible with newer versions.\n\nIf you want to use a newer version of Origins and I have not updated the patch yet, please feel free to open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/thermoo-patches/issues) and I'll try and update it as soon as I can.\n\nYou can also use [Fabric Loader dependency overrides](https://wiki.fabricmc.net/tutorial:dependency_overrides) to bypass my incompatibility marker. However, this may result in issues and it would probably be better to wait for a Thermoo Patches update.\n\n---\n\nNote that other temperature mods, like EnvironmentZ and Tough as Nails are not currently planned. This is because these\nmods are largely redundant with Frostiful and Scorchful installed, so unfortunately I don't consider adding them to be a\nvery worthwhile use of my time. Feel free to PR these (or make your own separate patch mod) if you want them.\n\n### Removed Patches\n\nThese patches were previously part of Thermoo Patches, but were either substantially changed or removed.\n\n| Mod name                                                                       | Patch Description                                                                                                          | Implemented versions | Removal reason                                                                                     | \n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| [Ad Astra](https://modrinth.com/mod/ad-astra)                                  | Adds more extreme temperatures on various planets, and disables the normal temperature effects.                            | 1.20.1, 1.20.4       | Mod was discontinued for Fabric 1.21+                                                              | \n| [Origins](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins) (Thermoo Patches 3.1-)             | Blazeborn is empowered by heat, but freezes when even a little cold.                                                       | 1.20.1, 1.20.4, 1.21 | Only origin powers are provided, integration with specific origins is now left to modpack authors. |\n| [Mob Origins](https://modrinth.com/mod/moborigins) (Thermoo Patches 3.1-)      | Snow Golem is empowered by cold, but melts when warm.

The most important\nthing for any patch is that they MUST be optional. If the mod they are patching for is not loaded, then nothing should\ncrash or break. The only mods that are required by Thermoo Patches are Fabric API, Cloth Config, and, of course,\nThermoo.\n\n# Origins Powers\n\nThermoo Patches provides a few powers and datapack facilities for Modpack authors to use in Origins. However,\nintegrating these powers into\nspecific origins (like Blazeborn or Snow Golem) is left to you, as I have no idea what other mods you may want to\nintegrate with Origins.\n\nIt may be useful to have a read through the [Thermoo Wiki](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/thermoo/wiki) to better\nunderstand what these powers do, as things such as temperature changes and Frost/Heat Resistance are better defined\nthere.\n\n| Power ID                                 | Description                                                                                                                       | \n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `thermoo-patches:cold_immune`            | Adds a very large amount of Frost Resistance to affected entites, making them effectively immune to all cold temperature changes. |\n| `thermoo-patches:ignores_cold_effects`   | Makes the affected entity immune to Frostiful's *negative* temperature effects                                                    |\n| `thermoo-patches:cold_vulnerability`     | Doubles the amount of freezing that affected entities receive from cold temperature changes.                                      |\n| `thermoo-patches:extra_frost_resistance` | Gives affected entities 50% resistance to cold temperature changes                                                                |\n| `thermoo-patches:heat_immune`            | Adds a very large amount of Heat Resistance to affected entites, making them effectively immune to all warm temperature changes.  |\n| `thermoo-patches:ignores_heat_effects`   | Makes the affected entity immune to Scorchful's *negative* temperature effects                                                    |\n| `thermoo-patches:heat_vulnerability`     | Doubles the amount of heating that affected entities receive from warm temperature changes.                                       |\n| `thermoo-patches:extra_heat_resistance`  | Gives affected entities 50% resistance to warm temperature changes                                                                |\n\n| Predicate ID                 | Description                                                                                                       |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `thermoo-patches:can_freeze` | Whether the target is affected by negative temperature effects from cold (use instead of `frostiful:can_freeze`). | \n| `thermoo-patches:can_heat`   | Whether the target is affected by negative temperature effects from heat (use instead of `scorchful:can_heat`).   | \n",
