		"long_description": "ARRP But Different allows developers to dynamically create assets and data at runtime, allowing\ndevelopers to not have to pack extreme amounts of resources into mods for things such as dynamic,\nmod-dependent, item generation.\n\n### Note\n\nARRP But Different is a fork of the [ARRP](https://modrinth.com/mod/arrp) mod. This mod has made\nchanges to the system ARRP used, and also supports the NeoForge mod loader.\n\n## Status\n\nARRP But Different is still in a beta state. Please report any issues and bugs you find.\n\n### Support\n\nSupports the same generators that the original ARRP mod did, with some small syntax differences.\n\n### Events\n\nFabric supports all events. NeoForge _only_ supports \"BeforeUser\" currently.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Is this compatible with resource packs?\n\nYes, just like the original ARRP mod, this mod creates \"fake\" resource packs that are the second to\nlast in priority. This allows any other resource pack to override the resource packs created through\nthis mod.\n\nHowever, this means that Runtime Resource Packs (RRPs) cannot override resources created by other\nmods, but can still override Minecraft's resources.\n\n### Is this compatible with the original ARRP\n\nNo, this mod makes changes to the syntax and systems that ARRP used.\n\n## NeoForge Support\n\nThis mod also supports NeoForge alongside Fabric, but there is one small piece that does not translate\nnicely between the two loaders. The NeoForge version does not support all the entrypoints that the\nFabric version does due to the way mod loading works.\n\n## Using ARRP But Different\n\nFor information on how to use ARRP But Different, refer to the [docs](https://arrp-but-different.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nFor resource pack creators looking to add support for generated resources, refer to the [resource\ndumping page](https://arrp-but-different.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dumping-resources).\n",
