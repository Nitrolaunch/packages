your liking.\n\nThis data pack is inspired by **Atomic Stryker's** legendary [**Infernal Mobs**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/atomicstrykers-infernal-mobs) mod.\n\n## **Configure the Pack**\nMany aspects of this data pack can be configured by simply changing some score values.\n\nYou can access a **chat based configuration menu** while **ingame** by running the command `/function ps-mob:config` if you have operator permissions.\n\n<p><details><summary>\nSet the scoreboard values of the <code>ps-mob.config</code> scoreboard to your desired values!\n</summary>\n<table>\n  <tr>\n
