Many of it's features are inspired by ItemPhysic, this mod has however been built from the ground up for Fabric.\n\n \n\n## Features\n\n\n - **Fancy Item Rendering**: Items will spin while they fall, at a changing speed depending on how fast they're falling. When on the ground, they'll lay flat and compact stacks\n\n \n\n - **Enhanced Pickup and Tooltips**: You can pick up items by right-clicking them, even from a few blocks away. When looking at one, you'll see it's tooltip rendered below your crosshair.\n\n \n\n - **Item Filter**: The Item Filter is an Item that allows you to finely control which items you want to automatically pick up. You can configure it to use either a white- or blacklist and any items affected by that lsit will require you to explicitly pick them up using either a right-click or by sneaking. You can also globally disable auto-pickup in the config to force everyone to explicitly pick up all items.\n\n \n\n - **Item Throwing**: You can throw items by holding down the drop key for a period of time. The longer you hold it, the further you'll throw it. Items which have a damage modifier on them like Sword and Axes will also deal damage when they hit something after being thrown this way.\n\n \n\n - **Client-Only Mode**: You can use Interactic in a mode where it will automatically disable all server-side features and give you only the enhanced rendering and tooltips.\n\n \n\nAll of these features can be individually toggled in the config",
