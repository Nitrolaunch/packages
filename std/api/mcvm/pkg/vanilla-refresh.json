		"long_description": "\n\n\n\n# About:\n\nVanilla Refresh is a vanilla-like, quality of life expansion, adding features to Minecraft aimed to make small improvements to Minecraft in its immersion, gameplay, multiplayer, and creating. Each feature can be toggled on or off to your liking, so you can customize your Minecraft experience just how you want it.\n\n\n\n\n### Gameplay\nVanilla Refresh makes many small gameplay improvements to Minecraft. Know exactly your damage and progress on mobs: their health is now displayed when nearing them above your hotbar. Many community issues with gameplay have been made more fair: Baby Zombie health has been halved, Loyalty Tridents return from the void, and XP from far away homes on to the player.\n\n### Multiplayer\n\nMany of Vanilla Refresh's features are perfect for multiplayer, like player sitting to make for your perfect player hangout, equipable head banners for your clans and factions, or player souls which store your items on death secured away from other players.\n\n### Creative Mode Tools\n\nVanilla Refresh also comes with Creative Mode tools! Search the item menu through certain tagged items, which you can view them all by searching #vanilla_refresh: in the item search bar. You can also use wands, allowing you to instantly teleport yourself toward a selected location, instantly erase mobs, or clear surronding vegetation. Enter spectator mode and use a variety of actions, like teleporting to a random player or giving yourself night vision. Select from a list of block palletes and item sets to help you quickly get blocks for building or quickly equip a full suit of armor for fighting.\n\n### Servers\nVanilla Refresh adds many news additions to improve server experiences. Any player can now check to see what the server's configured Minecraft gamerules are with `/trigger gamerules`. A variety of player stats like deaths and play time are tracked by Vanilla Refresh and can be set on display easily on Tab list or Below player names. Players can view their own and other player stats with `/trigger stats`. Vanilla Refresh has an easy installation for servers that also works with existing worlds.\n\n\n# Config / Settings\n\n**Toggle features in the settings menu by using `/function vanilla_refresh:_settings` in chat**\n\n\n# Features:\n\nWith over 30+ features and still adding, Vanilla Refresh continues improving Minecraft. Any features you don't desire, you can disable and re-enable at anytime via the settings menu\n\n \n<details>\n  <summary>Show Features</summary>\n\n- Player Sitting\n  - Sit anywhere by facing straight down, crouching and right clicking.
