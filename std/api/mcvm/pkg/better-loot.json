It'll add more items into Vanilla's loot tables since lots of structures need it, such as Ancient Cities, End Cities and Nether Fortresses. Better Loot also makes \"emeralds\" the main economic unit of game, emeralds will generate in every loot chest, the amount of emeralds varies based on the rarity and difficulty of structure. One of the other changes Better Loot makes is decreasing the generation chance and amount of diamonds in loot chests, making loot tables more logical mathematically and more understandable if you are into loot tables.](https://i.imgur.com/I6nKRPl.png)",
