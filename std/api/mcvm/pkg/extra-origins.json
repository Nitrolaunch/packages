Red Cap boosts offense, Green Cap boosts defense, and Blue Cap boosts mobility. Changing Spores will decrease the abilities of the other two Caps.\n+ You can turn soil blocks into mycelium at the cost of hunger.\n+ You gain bonuses based on the Spore you have active when standing on mycelium. Red Cap increases attack speed, Green Cap grants knockback immunity, and Blue Cap amplifies jump height while sprinting..\n+- Food is decomposed before it's consumed, nullifying any status effects you would otherwise gain.\n\nüî® Inchling üî®\n+- You are significantly smaller than a human and have half as much health.\n+ You are immune to thorns and velocity based damage. You are not slowed by blocks such as sweet berry bushes or cobwebs. You can walk on powder snow.\n+ You exhaust much slower than others, requiring you to eat less.\n+ You are able to climb up any kind of wall, not just ladders.\n+ You can ride other players.\n\nü™ô Piglin ü™ô\n+ Golden tools deal extra damage and golden armor has additional protection. Golden equipment lasts much longer.\n+ You deal 75% more damage with crossbows.\n+ Piglins do not attack you unless provoked. Brutes will still attack on sight.\n- Your natural spawn will be in the Nether.\n+- When outside of the Nether, you zombify, becoming undead and immune to fire, but weaker. Eating golden food negates this effect for a while.\n- Your diet is restricted to meat, you can't eat vegetables. Golden food is still edible.\n- You have 2 less hearts of health than humans.\n- You are afraid of soul fire, becoming weak when near it.\n\n‚öõÔ∏è Nucleon ‚öõÔ∏è\n+- You have 3 random powers, each of which will decay into a new power after a certain amount of time.\n```\n\n## External Links\nSupport me on Ko-fi!
