		"long_description": "**We have rebranded!** This resourcepack combines the old \"Incendium Optional Resource Pack\" and \"Stardust Biome Name Fix\".\n# Sparkles: Stardust Labs Resourcepack\nThis is an **optional** resource pack for all of Stardust Labs' projects! Here are the main features:\n- Custom mob/item textures for Incendium\n- A fix to allow biome names to show on minimaps and similar mods\n- Translations for Incendium, and all future projects in need of them\n\n## Addons\nSparkles has a set goal: Incendium textures and translations. However, if you want more from the Stardust Labs datapacks/mods, we have addons! At this moment, we have only one.\n- [Alpha Islands](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/sparkles-addon-alpha-islands) adds old alpha textures to Terralith's two Alpha Islands biomes\n\n## Why can't I see some textures?\nIn order to see the custom textures/models for the mobs, shields, and Elytra, you must use a mod that supports custom entity textures. If on **Forge**, Optifine does work, but we no longer recommend Optifine in any scenario. Otherwise, for both **Fabric** and **Forge**, download the following mods:\n- [Entity Texture Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures)\n- [Entity Model Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features)\n- CIT Resewn\n  - [Fabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn)\n  - [Forge 1.18 - 1.19](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cit-reforged) (unofficial fork)\n  - [Forge 1.20](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forge-cit) (unofficial fork)\n\nDon't worry, though! They are **not required**, but just recommended. Most (~85%) of the other textures will display fine, such as the swords, tools, and items!\n\nIt should be noted that even though our [wiki](https://stardustlabs.miraheze.org/wiki/Incendium) shows the Voltaic Trident as having a texture, that texture is not implemented.\n\n## What about Bedrock Edition?\nSome Java server owners may choose to run their Incendium server using GeyserMC, which allows Bedrock users to connect. However, Java resourcepacks do not work on Bedrock, so Bedrock users will not be able to enjoy the textures. Thankfully [**Dat1Mexican**](https://modrinth.com/user/Dat1Mexican) has created a Bedrock port of Sparkles! You can check it out [here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/sparkles-incendium-geysermc-pack/).\n\n## Can I translate it to my own language?\nYes! This resourcepack provides translations for several languages just by using it. They are added the the main resourcepack periodically. Click the button below to visit our translation website - this is the *only* place we accept translation contributions. If you need assistance with contributing, ask in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/stardustlabs).\n\n[![Weblate project translated](https://img.shields.io/weblate/progress/stardust-labs?server=https%3A%2F%2Fweblate.catter.dev&style=for-the-badge&logo=weblate&cacheSeconds=86400)](https://weblate.catter.dev/projects/stardust-labs)\n\n-----\n\n### Credits\n- Kuma, for making the original [Biome Name Fix](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/stardust-biome-name-fix) resourcepack. This handled just the biome translations, until it was merged into Sparkles.\n- Tera, for the creation of the original Incendium Optional Resourcepack. It has now been \"recreated\" into this one.",
