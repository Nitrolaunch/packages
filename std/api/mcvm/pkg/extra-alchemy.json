The book is still WIP and has no recipe, but you can get and read it in creative mode  \n- [NoMoreGlowingPotions](https://modrinth.com/mod/nomoreglowingpots) is highly suggested to appreciate the actual potion colors, instead of the weird glowing effect that makes them all look the same.  \n\n## Potions and Recipes\n  \n  \nEvery single potion recipe can be individually disabled in the config file.  \nAll potions in this mod are brewed in the vanilla Brewing Stand with vanilla items and have the standard splash, lingering and arrow variants; some of them may also have redstone and glowstone enhancements.  \nNot all potions are available in fabric yet. I'm slowly working on it, don't worry!  \n \n## Brewing Stand Tweak\n  \n  \nThere are two kind of people in this world, those who like the blaze powder requirement for brewing stands, and those who don't. I belong to the latter. A config now allows brewing stands to be powered by a fire underneath, or really anything made of fire/lava material. It is kinda slow, but I feel like it is a good compromise for fuel, it makes so much more sense to me. Note that blaze powder will still work, this is just an alternative. The option can be turned off in the config.  \nHeat sources and conductive materials can be specified through the tags `extraalchemy:heat_source` and `extraalchemy:heat_conductor`.\n \n## Vials\n  \n  \nVials are my version of a stackable potion system. Craft a splash potion with an empty vial to get a vial of the potion, or right click an empty vial to fill with the first potion found in your inventory. Vials apply the effect on the player immediately and can be stacked up to 16. To craft an empty vial make the same recipe of a glass bottle in the bottom rows and put a flint in the top-center slot.\n\n## Potion Bag\n\n\nThe potion bag is a handy way to carry around your potions. You can store any drinkable brew inside, and select one type to have quick access to. To access the bag interface shift-right click the bag. Using a simple right click will administer the potion, or it will select the next available type when you run out of the selected one.  \nA keybind can be used while holding a bag to decide what happens when a potion runs out: deselect everything, select next potion, or keep unavailable potion selected.  \nYou can also dye them like leather armor! (They should retain their settings and inventory in doing so, too)\n\n## Potion Rings\n\n\nThe potion rings are a way to have a semi-persistent potion effect. Combine an empty ring with any valid vanilla potion to get the corresponding ring.   \nThis feature can be disabled or configured through the config file.  \nThe ring will apply the potion over time to the wearer, and every available potion is customized to allow different xp costs for more powerful potions.  \nEvery potion also has a customized duration when applied, and XP cost and renewal time can be defined separatedly (aka: no more flashing night vision potion, as the renewal time is at 18s, making the potion go from 36s to 18s, instead of waiting for it to go all the way to 0).  \nNew potions with custom XP cost, level, duration and renewal time can be defined through the vanilla recipe system which is automatically fetched from the server on connection. [Example](https://github.com/zabi94/ExtraAlchemy/tree/1.16-fabric/src/main/resources/data/extraalchemy/recipes/ring_recipes).  \nUsing the same name of a mod-defined json, and setting the output to be a \"useless potion\" (water/awkward/mundane/thick...) will disable that ring.  \nWhen Trinkets is installed, rings will work in the ring slot!  \nYou can create your own rings through [this tool](https://zabi94.dev/ring_gen/)\n\n\n## Potion Tooltip Icons\n\nSince 1.18.2 there's the option to see the potion icons on the tooltips of potion-bearing items, like drinking/splash/lingering potions, tipped arrows, vials, potion rings and loaded potion bags:\n\n![potion icon image](https://zabi94.dev/mc_screenshots/tooltip_icons.png)\n\n\n## Bug Support\n  \n1) Install the latest available version for your minecraft version and try again   \n2) If the bug still persist, open a new issue **on Github**  \n\n\n \n## Will you port to...?\n  \n- Past versions: No. Stop asking.\n- Future versions: Sure, on fabric, when I have time. Keep in mind I have a life and a full time job.\n- Forge: No. [Gretchen, stop trying to make Forge happen, it's not going to happen](https://youtu.be/Pubd-spHN-0?t=2). Not even if someone else offers. _I don't want to_ have a forge version.\n\n\n## Currently supported versions:  \n- 1.19.2 and before: No  \n- **1.19.3**: Supported  \n- **1.20 snapshots**: development will begin shortly\n\n\n## Modpack policy\n  \n  \nYou can redistribute the jar **as part of modpacks** if you include a link redirecting to either this page or Curseforge's page.   \n\nDo not redistribute the mod as a single jar, please.\n\nAt the current time, multiple websites are violating this policy, so if you downloaded the mod from them or you visualized their ad-gates, you are actively supporting this practice; please, try to access the files from the original source.  \nJust to mention a few that you should avoid:  \n\n- minecraft-forum .net\n- 9minecraft .net\n- ign .com\n- 8minecraft .com\n- 9minecraft-mods.blogspot .it\n- minecraft-inside .ru\n\n[Read more here!](http://stopmodreposts.org) (You can also download and install a browser plugin from this link, it will help you block malicious sites)\n\n\n\n*Thanks to Vazkii and wiiv for kindly providing the original textures for the potion effects, and to she_is_long for reworking all of them (+item textures) to the new Minecraft art style! &lt;3*\n\n ",
