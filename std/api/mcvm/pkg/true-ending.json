Fight a now much stronger Ender Dragon, with increased health, new attacks, and new phases that progressively up the dragon's difficulty. Through other additions like longer lasting dragon breath, particle ambience, and a climatic final hit, the Ender Dragon fight is now much more exciting and more satisfying to beat.\n\n**Difficulty:** Damage from the True Ending Ender Dragon is scaled by difficulty, so if you're looking for a greater challenge, set your world's game mode to Hard. This also works by making the fight easier with Easy mode.\n\n# ♪ Boss Music\n\nTrue Ending adds boss music to the Ender Dragon boss fight! If you're using the datapack version, you'll have to [download the resource pack by clicking here](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/true-ending-ender-dragon-music). Mod users won't have to install the resource pack as its already nicely installed along the mod jar file.\n\n# Settings\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure multiple settings in True Ending, like the Ender Dragon's health, through its settings menu by using `/function true_ending:_settings` in chat.\n\n# All Features\n \n<details>\n  <summary>Show All Additions and Changes</summary>\n\n\n- Ender Dragon Health has increased from 200 HP to 300 HP\n- During the Ender Dragon boss fight, boss music now plays to all players at the center island\n- Ambient particles now surround the arena and players during the Ender Dragon fight\n- Added a dragon dive attack that creates a huge shockwave when the Ender Dragon hits the ground\n - Additionally, a variant where it performs 3 dives (Triple Dive) when perching at 75% health or lower\n- Added a chain fired Dragon Fireball attack\n- Added a huge laser attack\n- Added a final phase where the Ender Dragon hovers above the ground for the player to levitate and deal the last blow mid air.\n- Caged end crystal towers are now broken in a more intuitive way: A phantom guards it and when the phantom is killed, the cage is broken\n- At 10% HP the Ender Dragon will be immune to damage till perched. If not already perched or about to perch, it will forcefully perch after 30 seconds\n- Added an End Crystal counter when an End Crystal is broken displaying how many are left to break\n- Everyone within 128 blocks of the center end island now receives the \"Free the End\" advancement after defeating the Ender Dragon\n- Ender Dragon respawn animation revamped\n- When the Ender Dragon is respawned, a sound is played globally to all players in the end dimension\n- Dragon Breath/Area Effect Clouds from Dragon Fireballs duration increased from 30 seconds to 1 minute\n- Dragon Fireballs now deal damage directly on impact\n- Dropped Ender Pearls break from new Ender Dragon attacks (this is to prevent obtaining massive amounts of Ender Pearls from the Enderman killed during the fight)\n- Ender Dragon knockback resistance has been increased massively to prevent arrows from locking the dragon mid-air before perching\n- End Crystal fire is now soul fire\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n***\n\n[![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/89d7de50b2a682d1519c983d42d182f9099bcd33_0.webp)](https://youtu.be/gmK0zj07qsE)\n\n[![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/3a81bec138c36a57ea937c23d3478ecf01de0426.png)](https://discord.gg/XZVARKkjwt)\n\nJoin the Discord Server to chat, discuss, and get help with my mods!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/XZVARKkjwt\n\n[![image](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/52b59c5fe6e8fa9108d478bf6f9df7e9e1e5a7b4.png)](https://ko-fi.com/limesplatus/tiers)\n\n\nHelp support the making of my datapacks with memberships or donations on Ko-fi!\n\nhttps://ko-fi.com/limesplatus/tiers\n",
