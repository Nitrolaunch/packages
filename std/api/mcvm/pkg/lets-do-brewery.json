Brau Bier, beiss in a Bretzn – willkomme zum Braufescht!\n</center>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n \n \n__Key Features__\n<br>\n* Drying, brewing, drinking!\n* Brew your own Beer\n* ... or brew your own Whiskey!\n* Visit the Brew Festival and get yourself some beautiful attire! Lederhosen, shirts, Dirndl\n* New Building Blocks, new Food Blocks, new decorative Elements - All in the Style of the Oktoberfest\n<br>\n… and more\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n\n__Getting started__\n<br>\n<br>\n__Drying__\nOne of the basic ingredients for beer and whiskey is dried corn, wheat, or barley. To obtain this, you need a drying silo. Gather the corn, wheat, or barley, open the hatch of the silo with a skillful left-click (you need both hands for this! So make sure they are both empty!) and throw it into the silo. The silo connects in a 2x2 or 3x3 grid and can be extended up to a maximum height of 9. The larger the silo, the greater the capacity and the faster the drying\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n__Brewing__\nGreat job with the drying! Next up is the Brewing Station. To start the brewing process, you still need more ingredients. In most cases, hops, water, and coal. What? Coal in beer? No, no - it serves a different purpose. Let's take a normal wheat beer as an example: Throw two sacks of dried wheat and some hops into the brew kettle, fill it with water, and you're almost there. You've probably already noticed that the brew kettle is a bit larger and consists of several parts - now go to the part with the stove and fire it up with the coal. That's it!\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n__Brewing Process__\nThe brewing process lasts several seconds and requires your attention. Several small events occur at different parts of the Brewing Station, such as:\nThe furnace loses heat and requires more coal\nThe brewing kettle overheats; remove some water\n... and more to figure out \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n__Hops?__\nHops can be found in Taigas. Yes - even in those from [insert any Worldgen Mod that uses the #is_taiga tag here]. To grow hops, you need a somewhat elaborate construction: Build two fence posts with a height of three blocks (or more - higher is always better!) and connect them with a rope. Then you can plant the hops at the lowest point of the rope on farmland. Of course, you can also use the ropes for other things: fences, railings - let your creativity run wild! :)\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n__Hops?__\nHops can be found in Taigas.

The armor pieces are sold by villagers. You can either find them at the Brew Festival or you can provide them with a Bar Counter to work at. One part of the armor set cannot be purchased and must be obtained in another way - but I'll leave it to you to figure that out.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFeeling lost? Advancement could give you a few hints \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n <center>Have lots of fun and enjoyment with this little mod! :) \n</center>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<center>1.19.2 and above requires Architectury</center>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n <center>Dedicated to MissLilitu</center>\n \n ",
